Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Project
Overview
Welcome to the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Project! As a newly hired data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, your first assignment involves conducting a research project on employees from the 1980s and 1990s. The project entails designing SQL tables based on six CSV files, importing the data into a SQL database, and conducting data analysis tasks.

Project Tasks

Data Modeling:
- Review the provided CSV files to understand their structure and relationships.
- Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize how tables will relate to each other.

Data Engineering:
- Develop a table schema in SQL (schema.sql) that matches the ERD.
- Define appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints for each table.
- Ensure that tables are created in the correct order to handle dependencies.

Data Analysis:
- Write SQL queries (queries.sql) to extract specific information from the database.
- Answer questions about the data, such as employee details, hiring trends, and departmental information.
- Use SQL aggregations and filtering to generate meaningful insights from the data.
- Repository Structure

- List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

- List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

- List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

- List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

- List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

- List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

- List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

- List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).


Files and Directories

Instructions

Data Modeling
Inspect the provided CSV files.
Sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using a tool like QuickDBD to visualize the relationships between tables.

Data Engineering
- Create a table schema (schema.sql) based on the ERD.
- Define data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
- Ensure uniqueness with appropriate keys (composite if necessary).
- Order table creation to handle dependencies with foreign keys.
- Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

Data Analysis
- Write SQL queries (queries.sql) to answer specific questions about the data.
- List employee details (number, last name, first name, sex, salary).
- Filter and aggregate data to extract required information (e.g., employees hired in 1986, employee counts by last name).

Getting Started
- Clone the sql-challenge repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the EmployeeSQL directory.
- Use schema.sql to create your database tables in your preferred SQL environment.
- Import the CSV files into their respective tables.
- Use queries.sql to perform the specified data analysis tasks.

Notes
- Ensure all SQL scripts are well-commented and organized for clarity.
- Use appropriate SQL syntax for your database system.
- Document any assumptions or considerations made during the project.
